## C#.NET Projects

These are projects from my GIS Application Development Masters class at Penn State.
All the following projects are Esri Add-Ins and are written for 10.4.1.

## BatchFeaturestoGraphics
This application converts all the selected features in your map extent to graphics.

## ZoomToolbar

This application is a zoom menu for your map extent.

## LayerAdding

This application adds street and ortho layers to your map, based on an index and spatial filter.

## SiteSelection

This application automates the site selection process for Jen and Berry's Ice Cream store. The form takes in criteria and the output is a selection of cities that fit that criteria.
